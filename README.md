# Measure_temperature_using_arduino
A simple device to measure temperature of its surrounding with temperature sensor (TMP36) 

Components required to build the circuit:-
1. Arduino
2. LCD 16X2
3. Potentiometer
4. Temperature sensor (tmp36)
5. Resistor 1k ohm
6. and some wires (something to connect the feelings)

Code:-
Connect arduino with arduino ide and upload the code from code file and let the magic begin
